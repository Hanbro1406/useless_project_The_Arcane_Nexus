# [Sandsyra: The Origin (a visual novel)] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [The Arcane Nexus]

### Project Description
Sandsyra: The Origin is a small game(visual novel) based on the predestination paradox and time-traveling theme.
We have used py game library extension to implement this project.
The predestination paradox is a time-travel concept in which an event is both a cause and an effect of itself. We got inspired by the movie Predestination  2014 and the Dark series NFLX.
The storyline is that the protagonist loses his wife in a blast that takes place at their lab. So he invents a time machine to prevent his wife's death. This game shows his journey to the past and its aftereffects. By implementing the concept of a predestination paradox, our protagonist is the one who made the blast happen. So in this story, the protagonist's actions are the cause and effects that killed his wife. 


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Our main protagonist, Jonas, is on the way to change something in the past so that he can prevent his wife's death. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By time traveling. (But he can't change the past because everything is predestined)
